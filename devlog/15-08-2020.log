Today i'm creating a shader parser.

Basically i'm separating my shaders inside a specific folder and files with shaders code. As long it is just string, i'll program a shader parser to input it inside my source code.

Followed theCherno again, but i've noticed something different. Well, apparently the version supported by my installed specs is the GLES 3.1. It is a little bit different because i have to specify the desired precision for float values in my shaders. Besides that, i can modify the color of the triangle in my screen.

my main.cpp is increasing and i think that i can separate some behaviour in different files, but that is an issue for another day.
