It has been a time that i didn't continue this projetct. I explain. There's another git repository that i was giving attention called https://github.com/90felipe09/OpenCL-Studies. And also i finally had that final test that i was afraid of failing, but now, here i am. Back to the track.

Now i will abstract the shader part in order to take off the shader parsing and shader configuration from the main.cpp. Also i've separated the header files to the /include directory.

It looks really nice now.

Now i'm following the video of a Basic Renderer from theCherno in order to implement the renderer class. Basically it centralizes the clear and binding methods and clears the main.cpp even more. 

Also, i had to fix some circular references.

Now i've managed to implement texture class and bind it to the shader. I've use a obama photo because i do want to follow towards the obamium meme. Here we go, that's it for today.
