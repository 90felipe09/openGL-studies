Started figuring out how to properly compile this project with a makefile. Now i know why tutorials prefer using visual studio community.

First of all, i know my main.cpp calls GLFW/glfw3.h. So i just need to compile it with it.

INCLUDES = -Isrc/include
g++ -std=c++11 -c src/main.cpp $(INCLUDES) -o ./build/main.o

By adding it i'm using a G++ compiler with standard version 11. I'll compile my main.cpp in the build folder with the specification of headers includes for it to find glfw3.h;

It works. I do can generate main.o. But i know that i've not linked it along the static librari libglfw3.a.

It looks like that i'll have to specify it.

Well. There are a load of references to make. So i'll use cMake as a stack overflow entry is suggesting...

After that, got some errors such as couldn't find some libraries. There's a suggestion to install libgl1-mesa-dev. But do i really need it?
I decided that i don't to do it. I don't CMake, let's go back with Makefile.

Ok recompose yourself.

First, i will specify where to my compiler search for lib files:

LIBRARIES = -L./src/lib

And then, one by one, i defined the ones that were required:

LINKER_LIBS := -lglfw3 -ldl -lm -lX11 -lpthread

So finally:

build/GameEngine: build/main.o
	g++ -o build/GameEngine $(LIBRARIES) build/main.o $(LINKER_LIBS)

And bang. It works.

Lol! I did it! I've created the build system for linux, i've compiled from source an open source project and generated my hello world with static linking.

Well it's a good setup. Time for a git commit in setup.

Now the next step is to build and include GLEW. It's an OS lib that dinamically links my project with the function pointers implementations from my graphic card drivers. So in order to effectively draw things and make it work, i'll need this thing GLFW is just a lib that facilitates API access by providing helper functions for creating windows, resizing, receiving and transmitting inputs and so on. As i can tell, it's just a container context that my gpu will work on.

I've downloaded glew from this site (http://glew.sourceforge.net/). Well. There's a cute makefile here. I'll execute.
Ok, errors because it didn't find some libs... ah! in their docs they recommend installing these deps:
sudo apt-get install libXmu-dev libXi-dev libgl-dev dos2unix git wget
got some errors from libXmu-dev libXi-dev because it couldn't find. So i removed then and i'll try to build just with those...

Ok... it worked. But it's because i think those libXmu are already installed.

Now i added the libGLEW.a corresponding to this build inside my lib folder and i will copy paste the include content to my include folder.

Now for today i'll setup this at least to the point that i create a window as it's described on page 18.

Forget it. Followed TheCherno. Now I rendered a triangle on my screen! Yes! Hello world accomplished! Oh my god i'm so proud of myself!

That's it for today. Tomorrow i think about doing another commit.
